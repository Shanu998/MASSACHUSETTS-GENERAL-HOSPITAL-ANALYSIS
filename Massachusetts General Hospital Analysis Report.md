## **Introduction**

This project focuses on analyzing operational, clinical, and financial data from Massachusetts Hospital using Structured Query Language (SQL). The objective is to discover insights into patient demographics, hospital encounters, insurance payments, procedure costs, and overall performance to drive data-driven decisions across departments and stakeholders.

## **Project Description**

Massachusetts Hospital operates in a dynamic healthcare environment where patient care, billing, insurance, and clinical performance intersect. This project uses a dataset exported from a hospital management system to visualize and analyze patient inflows, encounter types, procedure volumes, costs, and payer distributions.
The analysis covers five core areas:

* Overview
* Patients
* Encounters
* Procedures
* Insurance (Payers)


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Aim

The main objective of this project is to analyze Massachusetts Hospital's performance and answer key healthcare business questions:

âœ… What are the key drivers of hospital cost and revenue?

âœ… What patient demographics are most common, and how do they affect care delivery?

âœ… How are hospital encounters distributed throughout the year?

âœ… Which procedures are most frequent and expensive?

âœ… What role do insurers play in covering the cost of care?

## **Tools & Technologies**
- **SQL (Microsift SQL Server)** â†’ data cleaning & transformation  
- **Power BI** â†’ dashboarding & storytelling

## **Importing the Dataset to SQL**

The dataset was imported as a CSV file into Microsoft SQL Server. A duplicate copy was created before commencement of data cleaning process.

## **Preparation of the Dataset: Cleaning and Transforming**

- **Creation of Database: Massachusettts_GH**
- **Assigned Correct Data Types**
- **Creation of Backup files**
- **Renamed column headers to enhance readability and understanding**
- **Identification of Null values**
- **Identified and Removed Duplicates**   
- **Replaced Null values with Unknown and 0 appropriately**  
- **Creation of a new column within the patient table 'is_deceased' to flag either patient is alive or dead using 1 or 0** 
- **Creation of a new column 'Fullname' - Concenate First and Last name to Fullname**
- **Standardized Gender, Marital status and encounter_class columns**
- **Standardized Name column by removing the numerical values embedded in the text**
