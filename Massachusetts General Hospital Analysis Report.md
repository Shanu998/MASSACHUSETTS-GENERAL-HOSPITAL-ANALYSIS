## **Introduction**

This project focuses on analyzing operational, clinical, and financial data from Massachusetts Hospital using Structured Query Language (SQL). The objective is to discover insights into patient demographics, hospital encounters, insurance payments, procedure costs, and overall performance to drive data-driven decisions across departments and stakeholders.

## **Project Description**

Massachusetts Hospital operates in a dynamic healthcare environment where patient care, billing, insurance, and clinical performance intersect. This project uses a dataset exported from a hospital management system to visualize and analyze patient inflows, encounter types, procedure volumes, costs, and payer distributions.
The analysis covers five core areas:

* Overview
* Patients
* Encounters
* Procedures
* Insurance (Payers)


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Aim

The main objective of this project is to analyze Massachusetts Hospital's performance and answer key healthcare business questions:

âœ… What are the key drivers of hospital cost and revenue?

âœ… What patient demographics are most common, and how do they affect care delivery?

âœ… How are hospital encounters distributed throughout the year?

âœ… Which procedures are most frequent and expensive?

âœ… What role do insurers play in covering the cost of care?
